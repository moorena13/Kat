# Kat
A very rudimentary chatbot written in Clojure. Rather than pre-programming certain responses, I wanted Kat to link together words based on how people talked to her, similar to how human children learn. She currently echoes the sentence construction of the input she is given. For future directions, I would like her to store sentence construction patterns received from input and populate those with her own vocabulary. I also would be interested in having her learn words from a dictionary text file and increase word connections by "reading" novels or other text material rather than strictly through limited dialogue with a human (me). Written in the spring of 2017.
